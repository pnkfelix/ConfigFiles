This directory is designed to be linked as the Racket addon-dir.

This directory is designed, if possible, to be linked directly to the
parent directory that Racket identifies as `(find-system-path
'addon-dir).

For example, for me, on Mac OS X the addon-dir for Racket is:
  /Users/pnkfelix/Library/Racket/

If the directory already exists and you do not want to replace it with
a symlink to this directory, or if you want more customized control
over what gets added to your addon-dir, then of course you have the
option of sym-linking in contents of this directory into your own
addon-dir on a case-by-case basis.
