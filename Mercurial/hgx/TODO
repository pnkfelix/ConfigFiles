- wrap the following script in something...it can be used for the unicode issue
  p4 submit -c 722537 | grep "//depot" | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs -I {} p4 reopen -c 722537 -t text {}

Usability
=========

- branch_create, branch_push_pull, etc could inspect clientspec state
  and report if specified paths are not visible.

- hgx_clone help doc is misleading; says created clientspec is (p4_user)-(2nd-paramater), but its really the basename of the 2nd-parameter, which is significant if e.g. one does
  % hgx_clone <depot/bar> bar/foo ; hgx_clone <depot/baz> baz/foo ;

ICONV issue in build
===========

.strings files were pulled as utf-8 but build requires utf-16.  command translates them back

   find . -name \*strings | xargs -I {} -n 1 sh -c "iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16 > t ; mv '{}' '{}'.orig-utf8 ; mv t '{}'"


Cygwin
======
- hgx_clone will fail after creating the spec. Need to run hg clone command on a *DOS* prompt.  An example is below:

      hg clone --encodingmode=ignore --traceback p4://theoden:1666/rreitmai-pc-sbox-main pc-sbox-main/clone

 may need to 'rm -r pc-sbox-main/clone' before doing so.

- General issue is with p4 commands running under cygwin = not happy.
