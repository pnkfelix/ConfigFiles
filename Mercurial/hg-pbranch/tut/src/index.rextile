"Patch branches":pbranch/index.htm (pbranch) is a way to develop a series of patches for submission into a main repo. This is for when the main repo does not want to track the detailed evolution of the patches, so you cannot use plain branching and merging. But during the patches' development, you do want to track the detailed evolution and want to collaborate with team members as naturally as on a normal branch, including exchange and reviewing of changesets. So stacks allow to develop patches as basically normal Mercurial branches, which later get thrown away (or archived) when the patches have been accepted.
